    This file contains a set of SQL queries related to:
    - Data quality analysis (e.g., detecting errors, missing values, duplicates)
    - Cleaning and validating customer data
    - Creating views and helper tables for further analysis
    - Verifying data correctness (e.g., email and phone formats)
    - Analyzing orders and customers (e.g., activity, statuses)
    - Basic statistics such as average order value

    Each query is accompanied by a comment explaining its purpose.

    The file should be executed in full and in the given order to maintain consistency and result accuracy.
